# RepMail Engineering Handoff

**For:** New engineers joining the RepMail project  
**Verified against:** commit `5b396b9` (2026-06-16)  
**Detailed reference:** `REPMAIL_ENGINEERING_HANDOFF.md` — full schema, security design, SNS, queue worker, cleanup jobs, AI governance

## What RepMail Is

RepMail is a B2B email campaign platform for sales teams. Administrators create user accounts, allocate sending credits, and users send direct-outreach campaigns to imported contact lists. It is not a newsletter tool. Key characteristics: per-email credit billing, BullMQ async queue with inline fallback when Redis is unavailable, full SES delivery telemetry (bounce/complaint/open/click), and a three-tier org hierarchy (ROOT_ADMIN → SUB_ADMIN → USER).

---

## Local Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AKSINGH-0704/Let-sZero.git
cd Let-sZero
npm install
npm run dev
```

No database, Redis, or AWS credentials needed. An in-memory storage shim handles everything locally. A `ROOT_ADMIN` account is created automatically on first boot. Server starts at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## Production Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|:------|:-----------|
| Runtime | Node.js ESM + Express 4 |
| Database | PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM (`DATABASE_URL`) |
| Queue | BullMQ 5.x over IORedis (`REDIS_URL`) |
| Email delivery | Nodemailer → AWS SES SMTP (NOT AWS SDK) |
| Delivery events | AWS SNS → `POST /api/webhooks/ses` |
| AI features | OpenAI GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini (plan-tiered) |
| Payments | **Razorpay only** (INR). Stripe is fully removed. |
| Deployment | Railway — single Node.js process + PostgreSQL + Redis services |

---

## Current State (commits through `5b396b9`)

**Financial integrity (commit `ecb1331` — FIN-1/FIN-2):**
- `completePayment` race eliminated: `.returning({ id })` on the payment UPDATE gates credit allocation on whether THIS caller transitioned `PENDING → SUCCESS`. Concurrent webhook + /verify callers cannot both allocate credits.
- `allocateCredits` race eliminated: balance check moved into the transaction as a conditional WHERE clause, matching the proven pattern of `deductCreditAtomic`. Concurrent allocations cannot overdraw the parent balance.

**Authentication hardening (commit `a279203` — B-PL-2):**
- `app.set("trust proxy", 1)` added to `server/index.js` before any middleware. loginLimiter (5 req/15 min) now keys on the real client IP from `X-Forwarded-For` rather than Railway's proxy IP.

**Payments (commit `f7f892e`):**
- Razorpay-only checkout: `POST /api/payments/initiate` → frontend modal → `POST /api/payments/razorpay/verify` → webhook `POST /api/webhooks/razorpay`
- `server/razorpayWebhook.js`: HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, `order.paid` → credit fulfillment, `payment.failed` handling, dispute logging; registered before `express.json()` in `server/index.js`

**Campaign execution parity (commit `826aa25` — GAP-1):**
- `executeCampaign` (inline fallback path) now has full parity with `processCampaign` (BullMQ path): `sendPaused` pre-check, `senderHealth` auto-pause, `sendWithRetry` integration, PAUSED terminal-state guard
- `sendWithRetry` exported from `worker.js` and imported by `routes.js`

**Security hardening (commits `71c0241`, `47e0d49`):**
- `mustResetPassword` enforced server-side in `authMiddleware` (routes.js:115); **correct** exempt paths: `/api/auth/me`, `/api/auth/reset-password`, `/api/auth/logout` (B-1 fix: was wrongly `change-password`)
- Global send pause checked pre-loop in both `worker.js` and `routes.js executeCampaign`
- Sender profile gate: `senderName + senderCompany` required before AI template generation (GAP-6)
- Invite accept checks inviter's plan member limit before creating user

**AI system (commit `f69b4ab`):**
- 6 campaign type preambles: `b2b_outreach`, `real_estate`, `recruitment`, `partnership`, `follow_up`, `general`
- 4 tones: professional, friendly, formal, casual
- Sender identity block in generation prompt; `real_estate` suppresses company/title from sign-off
- Model tiering: enterprise/scale/growth → `gpt-4o`; others → `gpt-4o-mini`

**Suppression visibility (commits `a6c25bf`, `379006a`):**
- `Suppressions.jsx`: full page at `/app/suppressions` — searchable/filterable table with source badge (BOUNCE/COMPLAINT/UNSUBSCRIBE/MANUAL), reason text, timestamp
- `GET /api/campaigns/:id`: SUPPRESSED `campaign_emails` records now enriched with `suppressionDetail: { source, reason, suppressedAt, scope }` via `getSuppressionDetailsForEmails()` batch lookup
- Campaign detail modal: Suppression column in Recipients table — source badge + reason + suppressedAt. Falls back to "Unknown suppression source" if no record found.
- Worker and inline `executeCampaign`: detailed suppression logging (scope, source, reason, suppressedAt) via `getSuppressionRecord()`
- New storage functions in both `dbStorage` and `memoryStorage` — no schema changes

**Deliverability hardening (commit `f2b4cfa`):**
- History.jsx false credit warning fixed: `sentEmails < totalEmails` replaced with `totalEmails - sentEmails - failedEmails - skippedEmails > 0` (true credit exhaustion detection). Separate blue banner for suppression-only skips.
- Unsubscribe footer: removed "outreach campaign" bulk-mail framing; first-person personal text only
- AI prompts: reframed from "marketing copywriter" to "personal one-to-one communication"
- Prohibited vocabulary expanded (exclusive, luxury, premium, bonus, grand opening, invitation, etc.)
- Subject validator: `PROMOTIONAL_SUBJECT_RE` pattern + 5 new `PROHIBITED_SUBJECT_STARTERS`

**Deliverability — DNS fix (2026-06-16, manual DNS action):**
- Duplicate `_dmarc.letszero.in` TXT record removed. Was: two records → RFC 7489 permerror → DMARC failed
- Now: one record `v=DMARC1; p=quarantine; adkim=r; aspf=r; rua=mailto:dmarc_rua@onsecureserver.net;`
- DKIM enabled and Verified in AWS SES console. Signs with `d=letszero.in` → DMARC alignment passes
- **Post-fix verification confirmed:** Gmail "Show original" — `spf=pass`, `dkim=pass`, `dmarc=pass`

**Deliverability — compliance headers (commit `5b396b9`):**
- `List-Unsubscribe: <URL>` — RFC 2369 header now on every campaign email (was body-only link)
- `List-Unsubscribe-Post: List-Unsubscribe=One-Click` — RFC 8058, enables Gmail one-click unsubscribe button
- `Feedback-ID: {campaignEmailId}:repmail` — Gmail Postmaster Tools complaint tracking
- All three merge into a single `headers` object alongside existing `X-SES-*` headers
- `buildUnsubscribeFooter()` now returns `url` — no duplicate token generation; header and body link share one URL
- `tmp/test-campaign-path.mjs` — production-path test utility that calls `sendCampaignEmail()` directly

---

## Current Priorities

**No further feature or architecture work.** Only production verification, deliverability confirmation, and the Free Plan deployment sequence below.

**Order:**
1. ~~Confirm Railway deployed commits `a6c25bf` + `f2b4cfa` + `379006a`~~ *(DONE — commits through `5b396b9` on `origin/main` and Railway)*
2. ~~Send one test email to Gmail — confirm `dmarc=pass`~~ *(DONE — `spf=pass dkim=pass dmarc=pass` confirmed 2026-06-16)*
3. ~~Add RFC compliance headers~~ *(DONE — `5b396b9`: `List-Unsubscribe`, `List-Unsubscribe-Post`, `Feedback-ID`)*
4. Confirm Gmail placement for the 2026-06-16 production-path send (Primary / Promotions / Spam)
5. Complete T-1 through T-5 production verification (SES send, SNS bounce, SNS complaint, unsubscribe, APP_URL)
6. Execute Free Plan deployment runbook (see section below)
7. Post-deploy Free Plan validation (Step 7 of runbook)
8. T-6, T-7, T-8 can follow

**~~IMMEDIATE CHECK:~~** *(RESOLVED)* Commit `a6b0f65` `free_credits_used`/`free_credits_reset_at` column error was encountered in production (`[INACTIVITY JOB] Fatal error: column "free_credits_used" does not exist`) and resolved via `npm run db:push -- --force`. Columns exist in production DB.

All gaps from the AI & production audit are resolved. The remaining items are from the final production-readiness audit (2026-06-10/11). Ordered by risk.

**~~1. I-2 — validateTemplate placeholder hard-block~~** *(RESOLVED — commit 306b391)*

`PLACEHOLDER_IN_SUBJECT` and `PLACEHOLDER_IN_BODY` are now hard blocks. Unknown `{{...}}` tags halt generation and trigger quota refund. Valid merge tags (`{{name}}`, `{{company}}`, `{{sender_name}}`, etc.) pass through for send-time substitution. 9/9 verification cases pass.

**~~2. I-5 — SNS_TOPIC_ARN startup enforcement~~** *(RESOLVED — commit f434b21)*

Fail-open `&&`-shortcircuit replaced with two explicit guards: `if (!expectedTopicArn) → 503` (fail-closed) then `if (TopicArn !== expectedTopicArn) → 403`. Startup check elevated from `console.warn` to `console.error`. 6/6 verification cases pass.

**~~SNS production configuration~~** *(VERIFIED IN PRODUCTION — 2026-06-11)*

SNS topic `repmail_events` confirmed existing. `SNS_TOPIC_ARN` added to Railway. HTTPS subscription `https://www.letszero.in/api/webhooks/ses` created and auto-confirmed. Railway logs: `[SNS] Subscription confirmed — HTTP 200`. SES → SNS → RepMail pipeline connected and live. SES Configuration Set event destination remains to be verified via first T-2 bounce event.

**~~0. O-2 — Invite token TTL verification~~** *(VERIFIED SAFE — 2026-06-11)*

`expiresAt NOT NULL` in schema. 7-day TTL written on every create and resend. Expiry enforced independently on both `/api/invites/validate` and `/api/invites/accept`. Single-use via `acceptedAt`. No code changes required.

**~~1. I-3 — Mid-loop sendPaused re-check~~** *(RESOLVED — commit 8eabc8a)*

Both `processCampaign` (worker.js) and `executeCampaign` (routes.js) now re-read `users.send_paused` from the DB at every 50th contact boundary, immediately after the existing global-pause re-check. If found true, campaign transitions to `PAUSED` with `reason=sender_paused_mid_loop`. Worst-case sends after a pause event reduced from N−1 to 49.

**~~2. I-4 — Inline-path isRetry duplicate-send guard~~** *(RESOLVED — commit bf17c19)*

`executeCampaign` now has full retry parity with `processCampaign`: `hasAnySentEmails` + `isRetry` computed once before the loop; `canStartCampaign` skipped on retry; per-contact `getCampaignEmailByContact` guard skips SENT, SUPPRESSED, BOUNCED, COMPLAINED, and permanently-FAILED contacts. Direct port of proven worker.js logic — no new storage methods.

## Free Plan — Implemented, Pending Production Verification

| Item | Status |
|:-----|:-------|
| Architecture | Finalized — Audit 011 |
| Implementation | Complete — Audit 012 (2 bugs found and fixed during verification) |
| `db:push` | NOT YET RUN |
| Feature flag | `FREE_PLAN_ENABLED` — NOT YET SET in Railway |
| Backfill | NOT YET RUN |
| Production verification | Blocked on T-1 through T-5 first |

**Deployment sequence (do not skip steps or reverse order):**
1. Complete T-1 through T-5 production verification
2. `npm run db:push` — adds `free_credits_used`, `free_credits_reset_at` columns (additive, safe)
3. Deploy current branch
4. Set `FREE_PLAN_ENABLED=true` in Railway env vars
5. Run backfill SQL: `UPDATE users SET is_trial_user = false WHERE plan = 'free' AND is_active = true;`
6. Verify: send one campaign as free plan user, confirm `credit_transactions` row with `type='free_usage'`

**Rollback (instant, no redeploy):**
- Set `FREE_PLAN_ENABLED=false`
- `UPDATE users SET is_trial_user = true WHERE plan = 'free' AND is_active = true;`

**Key architecture facts:**
- Two new columns only: `free_credits_used` (INTEGER DEFAULT 0) + `free_credits_reset_at` (TIMESTAMP NULL)
- Monthly grant derived at runtime from `MONTHLY_CREDITS[plan]` — not stored per-user
- Lazy refresh: fires on first credit-touching request after month boundary (WHERE clause guard, idempotent)
- Deduction order: free first, paid fallback, legacy trial last
- `isTrialUser=false` → free plan path; `isTrialUser=true` → legacy trial (5 credits)
- New users get `isTrialUser` derived from env, not DB default

**Bug fixes applied during verification (Audit 012):**
- `updateUser` now passes `freeCreditsUsed` and `freeCreditsResetAt` (Bug 1 — critical, silent drop)
- `createUser` now derives `isTrialUser` from `FREE_PLAN_ENABLED` env var (Bug 2 — new users on wrong path)

---

## Free Plan Deployment Runbook

Execute in this exact order. Do not proceed to the next step if the current step's verification fails.

### STEP 0 — IMMEDIATE: Check if `a6b0f65` is already deployed

Commit `a6b0f65` references `free_credits_used` and `free_credits_reset_at` in the Drizzle schema. If Railway auto-deployed it and `db:push` has not been run, all user queries are failing.

**Check Railway logs for:** `ERROR: column "free_credits_used" does not exist`

If present → run Step 2 (`db:push`) immediately before anything else.

---

### STEP 1 — Pause Railway auto-deploy

Railway dashboard → service → Settings → Source → disable auto-deploy.

Prevents a future git push from deploying mid-sequence.

---

### STEP 2 — `db:push`

Adds two columns to production `users` table. Zero downtime (catalog-only, no row rewrite).

```bash
# Option A: local with production DATABASE_URL
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..." npm run db:push

# Option B: Railway CLI
railway run npm run db:push
```

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'users'
  AND column_name IN ('free_credits_used', 'free_credits_reset_at');
```
Expected: 2 rows. `free_credits_used`: NOT NULL, default 0. `free_credits_reset_at`: nullable, no default.

---

### STEP 3 — Deploy code (Railway redeploy)

If `a6b0f65` not yet live: Railway dashboard → Deploy → Redeploy, or re-enable auto-deploy.

**Wait for deploy.** Confirm:
```bash
curl https://www.letszero.in/api/health
# Expected: {"status":"ok","smtp":"verified","worker":"running",...}
```

Downtime: ~30–60 seconds (Railway process restart).

---

### STEP 4 — Set `FREE_PLAN_ENABLED=true`

Railway dashboard → Variables → add `FREE_PLAN_ENABLED = true`.

Railway auto-redeploys on env var changes. Wait for redeploy, re-confirm health endpoint.

Downtime: ~30–60 seconds.

At this point: new users get `isTrialUser=false`. Existing users still have `isTrialUser=true` — no behavior change for them until Step 6.

---

### STEP 5 — Pre-backfill audit

```sql
-- Record baseline before backfill
SELECT plan, is_trial_user, COUNT(*)
FROM users WHERE is_active = true
GROUP BY plan, is_trial_user ORDER BY plan;

-- Confirm column defaults
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN free_credits_used = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS at_zero,
  SUM(CASE WHEN free_credits_reset_at IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_reset
FROM users WHERE plan = 'free' AND is_active = true;
-- Both at_zero and null_reset should equal total
```

Save the count of `plan='free', is_trial_user=true` — this is the rollback verification number.

---

### STEP 6 — Backfill

```sql
UPDATE users
SET is_trial_user = false
WHERE plan = 'free' AND is_active = true;
```

**Verify immediately:**
```sql
-- Should match the count from Step 5
SELECT COUNT(*) AS converted FROM users
WHERE plan = 'free' AND is_active = true AND is_trial_user = false;

-- Must be 0
SELECT COUNT(*) AS remaining FROM users
WHERE plan = 'free' AND is_active = true AND is_trial_user = true;
```

---

### STEP 7 — Post-deploy verification

```
[ ] GET /api/health → status:"ok"
[ ] GET /api/credits/info (free user) → isFreePlan:true, free:500, total:500, freeResetDate set
[ ] GET /api/pricing/plans → "trial" plan NOT in response
[ ] Dashboard: free credit section visible (X/500, progress bar, reset date)
[ ] Send 1-contact campaign as free user → COMPLETED
[ ] SELECT type, amount FROM credit_transactions WHERE user_id='<id>' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5
      → type='free_monthly_grant' and type='free_usage' both present
[ ] SELECT free_credits_used, free_credits_reset_at FROM users WHERE id='<id>'
      → free_credits_used=1, free_credits_reset_at IS NOT NULL
[ ] Paid user: GET /api/credits/info → isFreePlan:false, free:0
[ ] Paid user campaign → credit_transactions type='usage' (not 'free_usage')
```

---

### ROLLBACK

**Before Step 6 (backfill not run):**
```bash
# Railway dashboard: set FREE_PLAN_ENABLED=false (triggers redeploy)
# No SQL needed — columns exist but are never written with flag off
```

**After Step 6 (backfill ran):**
```sql
-- Immediate
UPDATE users SET is_trial_user = true
WHERE plan = 'free' AND is_active = true;
```
```bash
# Railway: set FREE_PLAN_ENABLED=false
```
```sql
-- Verify
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users
WHERE plan = 'free' AND is_active = true AND is_trial_user = true;
-- Must match the Step 5 baseline count
```

Full revert restores 100% of prior behavior. No code rollback needed. Columns remain harmlessly in DB.

## Explicit Non-Goals

Architectural decisions made deliberately. Do not implement without team discussion.

| Non-Goal | Reason |
|:---------|:-------|
| Per-contact OpenAI generation | 1 API call per recipient = unacceptable cost at scale |
| One AI call per email send | Same as above |
| Re-introducing Stripe | Razorpay is the only payment gateway |
| Breaking database migrations | Schema changes must be backward-compatible; use `drizzle-kit push` |
| Materially increasing OpenAI spend | All AI must be single-call per user action |
| Per-contact personalization via AI | Single template generation per campaign, period |

---
