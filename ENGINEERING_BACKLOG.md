# RepMail Engineering Backlog

**Purpose:** Single authoritative record of all deferred engineering work. Items here were identified during audits but not implemented in the milestone where they were found — either out of scope, lower priority, or dependent on future milestones.

**Process:**
- New items are added here when recorded in an audit (Audit 062+). Earlier findings are consolidated below from their original audit tables.
- When an item is implemented, mark it `[DONE]` with the implementing audit number. Do not delete entries.
- Severity: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
- Status: OPEN / IN PROGRESS / DONE / WONT FIX

**Related documents:**
- [AUDIT_TRAIL.md](./AUDIT_TRAIL.md) — Full audit history. Original finding context is there.
- [HANDOFF.md](./HANDOFF.md) — Current state, priorities, non-goals

## Security

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SEC-001 | **DONE** (Audit 064) | HIGH | **nodemailer CRLF injection in `List-*` headers** (nodemailer ≤ 9.0.0). Directly relevant when M5 adds `List-Unsubscribe` headers — a malicious or malformed unsubscribe URL could inject arbitrary headers. Sanitize the unsubscribe URL before injecting into headers. | Confirmed nodemailer vulnerability. Risk is latent now; becomes exploitable the moment `List-Unsubscribe` header is added. | M5 (must fix before implementing List-Unsubscribe) |
| SEC-002 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **drizzle-orm SQL injection** (drizzle-orm < 0.45.2). SQL injection via improperly escaped SQL identifiers. Risk is low in this codebase (typed column references used, not user-controlled identifiers), but dependency update is warranted. | Confirmed upstream CVE. Low exploitability given current usage patterns; update eliminates risk entirely. | P2 dependency update pass |
| SEC-003 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **`PUT /api/profile` writes no audit log.** Sender identity changes (name, domain, SMTP credentials) are not recorded. An attacker who gains account access can change sender identity without leaving a trace. | Audit trail gap for a high-value field. Sender identity directly affects deliverability and domain reputation. | M7 |

## Deliverability

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEL-001 | **DONE** (Audit 064) | HIGH | **`SNS_TOPIC_ARN` absence is not a startup error.** If SNS is unconfigured, bounce/complaint events are silently dropped, auto-pause never fires, and the platform can keep sending to an increasingly poisoned list. Should exit(1) on missing SNS_TOPIC_ARN in production. | Auto-pause is the only deliverability protection mechanism. Silent SNS failure defeats the entire system. Current behavior: logs a warning and continues. | M5 |
| DEL-002 | **DONE** (Audit 063) | MEDIUM | **`topBouncers` minimum vs auto-pause minimum misaligned.** Admin health dashboard shows top bouncers only for senders with ≥ 10 sent emails. Auto-pause enforcement threshold is ≥ 50 sent emails. A sender with 10–49 emails showing in the health dashboard cannot be auto-paused. Admin sees a "problem sender" they cannot enforce against. | Operational confusion. Admin may manually investigate a sender that auto-pause would never catch. | M4 |

## Reliability

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| REL-001 | **DONE** (Audit 063) | MEDIUM | **No startup warning when Redis is unavailable.** When `REDIS_URL` is unset or unreachable, campaigns silently fall back to the inline execution path (`executeCampaign` in routes.js). Inline-path campaigns cannot survive Railway redeployment (SIGTERM). Operators unfamiliar with this behavior encounter mysterious FAILED campaigns after deploys. A `[WARN] Redis unavailable — campaigns running on inline path. SIGTERM will abandon in-progress campaigns.` log at startup prevents confusion. | Operator safety. The behavior is documented in HANDOFF.md but documentation is passive; a runtime warning is active. | M4 |

## Performance

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| PERF-001 | OPEN | LOW | **No index on `campaigns.started_at`.** Three queries now filter or order on this column (`getUserSenderHealth`, `getDeliveryHealthStats` ×2). At current scale (< 10K campaigns) full-table scan is imperceptible. At 100K+ campaigns this will be the bottleneck. | Index creation is a one-line migration. Adding it now costs nothing; adding it later on a 100K-row table requires `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`. | P2 performance milestone |
| PERF-002 | OPEN | LOW | **`getUserById` called N times in global pause resume.** `POST /api/admin/platform/resume-sending` now fetches the campaign owner for every PAUSED campaign before re-queuing. At current scale (handful of paused campaigns) this is O(N) with small N. At scale with 100+ paused campaigns, the admin action blocks on N sequential queries. | Introduced as a correctness fix in M3A (prevents sender-health-paused campaigns from being re-queued). Should be batched via `getUsersByIds` or a campaign JOIN when O(N) becomes measurable. | M5 |
| PERF-003 | OPEN | LOW | **`getCampaignStatus()` adds 1 DB query per 50 contacts in the campaign loop.** Lightweight (1 column, primary key lookup) — at 14 emails/sec this fires every ~3.5 seconds. Fine for typical lists. Reconsider if contact lists routinely exceed 50K contacts (would fire ~28 times per second across 3 concurrent campaigns). | Not a current problem. Note here for scale planning. | M5+ |

## Scalability

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SCALE-001 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **Cleanup job overlap prevention uses process-local flags, not distributed locks.** If RepMail ever runs multiple server instances (horizontal scaling), each instance will run its own cleanup jobs. Jobs can overlap across instances, causing double-execution of AI quota resets, double-failure of stale campaigns, etc. Fix: replace `isRunning` boolean guards with Redis `SET NX` distributed locks. | Not a problem today (single Railway instance). Becomes critical the moment a second instance is spun up. Architecture change required before horizontal scaling is possible. | M6+ (horizontal scaling milestone) |

## Maintainability

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MAINT-001 | **DONE** (Audit 063) | HIGH | **`processCampaign` (worker.js) and `executeCampaign` (routes.js) are two ~400-line parallel functions with identical logic.** Every bug fix in M3A required applying the same change in both functions. Every future campaign feature (new status transitions, new exit conditions, A/B send, scheduled send improvements) will require the same doubling. Extract a shared `runCampaignLoop(campaignId, storage, options)` module. Both execution paths call the shared module; path-specific setup/teardown stays in their respective files. | Structural drift risk is currently HIGH. M3A applied 8 fixes twice. One missed application caused a subtle bug in a previous milestone. Without extraction, the next engineer touching this code will make the same mistake. | M4 |
| MAINT-002 | OPEN | LOW | **Inconsistent error field naming.** AI endpoint returns `{ code: "SENDER_PROFILE_REQUIRED" }`. Campaign endpoint returns `{ error: "SENDER_PROFILE_REQUIRED" }`. Frontend handles each differently. Any future unified error handling logic must account for both. | Small inconsistency. Low risk now, compounds with every new error code added. | P3 cleanup |
| MAINT-003 | OPEN | LOW | **CORS `allowedOrigins` hardcoded to localhost.** Safe in current single-origin deployment. Fragile if architecture changes (CDN, separate frontend hosting, subdomains). | Low risk; record for future architect awareness. | P3 |

## Technical Debt

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| DEBT-001 | OPEN | LOW | **Unused `Play` import in `ProgressTracker.jsx`.** Pre-existing unused import. No runtime impact (tree-shaking removes it). | Cosmetic. Record for housekeeping pass. | Housekeeping |
| DEBT-002 | **DONE** (Audit 064) | MEDIUM | **Dashboard CANCELLED regression.** `Dashboard.jsx` used a local `STATUS_DISPLAY` map with only 5 statuses (no CANCELLED or DRAFT). Identified in M5 Capability Review — a regression from M3B which introduced `campaignStatus.js` but only updated History.jsx and ProgressTracker.jsx. | CANCELLED campaigns appeared as "Queued" (gray badge, Clock icon). Fixed by importing `getStatusConfig` from `@/lib/campaignStatus` and removing local STATUS_DISPLAY and four local getter functions. | M5 |
| DEBT-003 | **DONE** (Audit 064) | HIGH | **No suppression delete endpoint or UI.** Suppressions page was add/view only. No `DELETE /api/suppressions/:id`, no `deleteSuppression` storage method, no delete button in Suppressions.jsx. | Full CRUD required for production suppression management. Fixed: `deleteSuppression(id, userId)` in storage.js + memoryStorage.js; `DELETE /api/suppressions/:id` route with audit log; Trash2 button + source-specific AlertDialog warning in Suppressions.jsx. | M5 |
| DEBT-004 | OPEN | LOW | **`sendTransactionalEmail` has no retry.** One transient SMTP failure drops the email permanently (payment receipts, invites). | P2 reliability improvement. Low urgency while send failure rate is low. | P2 |
| DEBT-005 | OPEN | LOW | **Contact import returns only counts, not which rows failed.** Users who import a partially-valid CSV cannot identify which emails were rejected without re-downloading and cross-referencing. | P2 UX improvement. Requires response-shape change on `POST /api/contacts/import`. | P2 |
| DEBT-006 | **DONE** (Audit 064) | LOW | **`MANUAL_SUPPRESSION_ADDED` raw string literal in routes.js.** Line 1088 used `"MANUAL_SUPPRESSION_ADDED"` instead of `AUDIT_ACTIONS.MANUAL_SUPPRESSION_ADDED`. Only audit action in the codebase not using the constant. | Audit trail consistency. Fixed: constant added to `AUDIT_ACTIONS` in schema.js (backward compatible — same string value); routes.js updated to reference constant. `SUPPRESSION_DELETED` added alongside it for DEBT-003. | M5 |

## UX

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| UX-001 | **DONE** (Audit 064) | MEDIUM | **`senderName` can be cleared while campaigns are queued.** `PUT /api/profile` does not warn if active/pending campaigns exist. A user who clears their sender name mid-campaign causes scheduled or queued campaigns to be sent as "RepMail" (the default fallback). Warn in `PUT /api/profile` if active/pending campaigns exist. | Direct customer impact. Silent deliverability degradation — user sees "RepMail" as the sender name in their own emails. | M5 |
| UX-002 | **DONE** (Audit 063) | LOW | **Cancel action in History table row.** Power users want to cancel campaigns from the list view without opening the ProgressTracker. Requires per-row cancel mutation + confirmation dialog. | Low urgency — cancel is available in ProgressTracker. History row cancel is a power-user convenience. | M4 |
| UX-003 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **No "export remaining contacts" path after CANCELLED.** Users who cancel a campaign mid-send cannot re-target the contacts that were not reached without manually reconstructing the list. Requires contact-level PENDING/FAILED state tracking to export a "not-yet-reached" segment. | Real recovery scenario: wrong-list cancel leaves 40% of the list unreached. User must re-upload and hope they match correctly. | M4+ (requires schema change) |
| UX-004 | **DONE** (Audit 063) | LOW | **Admin cannot cancel other users' campaigns from the History UI.** `POST /api/campaigns/:id/cancel` supports `req.isRootAdmin` but the History page has no cancel control for other users' campaigns. Admin must use the API directly. | Admin operational friction. Low urgency since direct API call is available. | M4 |

---

## Operations

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| OPS-001 | OPEN | MEDIUM | **Time-series AI cost trend not implemented.** Admin dashboard shows aggregate AI costs but no daily-bucketed trend. Operators cannot see if AI costs are spiking over time without querying the DB directly. Requires daily bucketing of `ai_usage_logs` (GROUP BY DATE(`created_at`)). | Cost visibility. Without trends, AI cost spikes are invisible until the billing statement arrives. | M5 |
| OPS-002 | OPEN | LOW | **Dead-letter queue management API not implemented.** `GET /api/admin/queue/failed` + `POST /api/admin/queue/failed/:jobId/retry`. BullMQ's failed job queue has no admin surface in the app. Operators must use Redis CLI or Bull Board directly. | Operational tooling. Low urgency while failure rate is low. | M5 |
| OPS-003 | OPEN | LOW | **Cross-user suppression admin tooling not implemented.** No API to query or remove suppressions across all users. Admin must query the DB directly. | Support tooling. Low urgency while user count is low. | M5 |
| OPS-004 | OPEN | LOW | **Per-user daily AI cost breakdown not implemented.** Admin can see top-10 AI users (aggregate) but not daily breakdown per user. Cannot identify when a specific user's AI usage spiked. | Cost attribution. Nice-to-have for abuse detection at scale. | M5+ |
| OPS-005 | OPEN | LOW | **`ai_usage_logs` abuse pattern detection not implemented.** No mechanism to detect repeated identical prompts (high `requestHash` similarity) that could indicate abuse or prompt injection. | Security-adjacent. Low urgency until AI costs become significant. | M6+ |

---

## Enterprise

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ENT-001 | OPEN | LOW | **Campaign-specific audit log endpoint.** `GET /api/campaigns/:id/audit` is documented as nice-to-have but the current `getAuditLogs` only supports `userId` and `action` filters — not `targetId`. An enterprise audit view per campaign requires adding `targetId` filter to `getAuditLogs`. | Audit completeness. Currently supported via admin audit trail filtered by campaign name. Low urgency. | M5 |

---

## Contact Library (M6)

| ID | Status | Severity | Description | Rationale | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M6-001 | OPEN | LOW | **Empty list campaign error is generic.** When a campaign is created via `listId` pointing to an empty list, the error is "No valid contacts remain after filtering" — identical to the upload-path zero-contacts error. A library-specific message ("Contact list is empty") would be clearer. | UX gap in library mode. Easy fix: check `listId` path and return distinct error. | M7 |
| M6-002 | OPEN | LOW | **`saveToLibraryAs` is fire-and-forget.** When `saveToLibraryAs` is set on campaign creation, the contact list creation runs in background without awaiting. If the DB write fails, the user receives no signal that the list was not saved. Campaign is created either way (intentional). | Non-critical data loss. User thinks list is saved but it may not be. Consider response field `libraryListId` indicating success/failure. | M7 |
| M6-003 | OPEN | LOW | **Contact list CSV export is a stub (501).** `GET /api/contact-lists/:id/export` returns 501 Not Implemented. CSV download is a common user expectation when managing contact lists. | Feature gap. Implement as CSV streaming response with query: `SELECT email, name, company, category FROM contacts JOIN contact_list_members ON ... WHERE list_id = ?`. | M7 |
| M6-004 | OPEN | INFO | **Large import timing not documented.** 50K-row imports run synchronously in 1K-row batches (4 DB queries each = ~200 round-trips). No progress signal is returned to the client during execution. At typical Railway Postgres latency, a 50K import takes ~20-40s. | Document expected timing; consider streaming response or progress webhooks for large files. | M8+ |

## Resolved / Won't Fix

| ID | Resolution | Description |
|---|---|---|
| F-M3A-5 | WON'T FIX | CANCELLED campaigns show `creditsUsed=0` if cancelled before checkpoint i=25. This is correct — 0 credits were consumed. The flush at cancel time writes `creditsUsed: sentCount` accurately. |
